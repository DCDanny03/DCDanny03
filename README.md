- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Cao!
I am a current Computer Science student at NC State University
I have a passion for technology and creatively innovating. I dabble in a bit of Network Security and plan to expand my knowledge of Cybersecurity Topics.
Currently, I am focusing on my education and trying to find internships, but on the side, I am trying to further my experience with my projects.
All projects done in class and personally will now be uploaded on Github as I further improve my portfolio.
